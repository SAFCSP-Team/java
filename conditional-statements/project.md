# Conditional Statements Project

## Objectives
This project aims to apply what you have learned about conditional statements.


## Problem
Implement a program that reads the **battery level**, decides whether it's **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**, and prints the result.

## Implementation

- The program should read the `batteryLevel` variable value, which is `96`.
- If `batteryLevel` value is above or equal to `80`, the program should print **High**.
- If `batteryLevel` value is above or equal to `50`, the program should print **Medium**.
- Else, the program should print **Low**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Implement and solve the project in two different ways (**Two solutions**).
> - Using the `if-else` statements.
> - Using the `switch` statement.


> [!TIP]
> The order of the conditions is critical and could change the result.


```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int batteryLevel = 70;
        // Add your code here
    }
}
```
