# Conditional Project

## Objectives
This project aims to apply what you have learned about conditional statements.

## Problem
Implement a program that reads the temperature, decides whether it's **hot**, **warm**, or **cold**, and prints the result.

## Implementation

#### 1. Implement and solve the project in two different ways (**Two solutions**).
- Using the `if-else` statements.
- Using the `switch` statement.

#### 2. The program should read the `temp` variable value, which is `70`.
- If `temp` value was above or equal `37`, the program should print **Hot**.
- If `temp` value was above or equal `30`, the program should print **Warm**.
- Else, the program should print **Cold**.



> [!TIP]
> The order of the conditions is critical and could change the result.

```java
    int temp = 70;
    // Add your code here
```
